This is a system for holding the game bots competititon at Omsk Summer School of Management and IT 2016. The game is [War of Viruses](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Война_вирусов).

Web part is written on NodeJS, bots processing part is written on Python.

Every battle could be replayed step by step in the player.

For safety bots are run in Docker containers (probably, this is overkill).

You can take a look at the system [here](http://178.62.210.71:3001/tournaments/0?official=true).
